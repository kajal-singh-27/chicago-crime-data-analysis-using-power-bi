Enhancing Public Safety ðŸš“ Welcome to the "Enhancing Public Safety" project repository! This project is dedicated to leveraging data analytics and Power BI to optimize law enforcement strategies and reduce crime rates, ultimately contributing to a safer community.

Key Findings and Recommendations: 1 -Data Cleaning & Preparation: Ensured dataset accuracy by addressing inconsistencies and missing values. 2 -Crime Type Analysis: Identified prevalent crime types to prioritize law enforcement focus areas. 3- Arrest Rate Evaluation: Assessed law enforcement effectiveness by analyzing the percentage of reported incidents resulting in arrests. 4- District Crime Distribution: Analyzed crime distribution across districts to pinpoint high-crime areas for targeted interventions. 5- Domestic Crime Proportion Analysis: Examined domestic crime ratios to inform intervention strategies. 6- Month-wise Crime Rate Trends: Detected patterns in monthly crime rate changes for resource allocation. 7- Crime Reduction Strategies: Developed multi-faceted strategies focusing on high-prevalence crime types for effective reduction. 8- High Crime Locality Solutions: Proposed measures to mitigate crime in high-crime areas for enhanced community safety. 9- Ward Security Enhancement: Identified wards needing security improvements and suggested specific measures for implementation. 10- Crime Rate Trend Monitoring: Tracked crime rate changes over time to adapt law enforcement strategies accordingly. 11- Domestic Crime Arrest Rates: Analyzed arrest rates for domestic crimes and identified trends for intervention. 12- High Domestic Crime Regions Identification: Identified regions with high domestic crime rates for targeted support. 13- Case Resolution Time Analysis: Analyzed case resolution time factors for optimized law enforcement efforts. 14- Ranking Crime Types by Occurrence: Prioritized crime types based on occurrence rates for focused law enforcement. 15- Understanding Power BI Gateway: Explored Power BI Gateway's functionalities and use cases for efficient data integration. 16- District Relationship Analysis: Investigated the relationship between districts and district IDs for seamless data integration.
